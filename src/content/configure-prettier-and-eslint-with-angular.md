# Configure Prettier and ESLint with Angular üé®

Everyone wants to write code in a fast bug-free way without thinking about its style most of the time. That‚Äôs why in this post I will talk about configuring [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in an [Angular](https://angular.io/) project.

## How does ESLint help?
By statically analyzing our code, ESLint can find problems and also suggest us fixes for them. And it can do better than that, it can fix our code automatically (who doesn‚Äôt want that?).

## Install and configure ESLint
In this section, I will explain how to install ESLint in an Angular project and also configure it to better align with the Angular style guide and community standards.

Open the terminal and install ESLint schematics using this command:

```bash
ng add @angular-eslint/schematics
```

_That was it._ Now we have ESLint installed and also configured thanks to `ng add` command provided by the [Angular-ESLint](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) team.

Example error and how ESLint helps to fix it:

![ESLint error about Angular input binding alias](eslint-error-fix.png)

ESLint error about Angular input binding alias

We can also run this command in terminal:

ng lint --fix
to fix all the fixable bugs in the project.

Install and configure Prettier
Even if we have ESLint watching our code for bugs, we also need a tool to better style and format it. That‚Äôs where Prettier comes into play.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that helps us beautify code in a standardized way every time we save the code.

Open terminal and type:

npm install prettier --save-dev
or if you‚Äôre using yarn :

yarn add prettier -D
Then we need to add .prettierrc.json and .prettierignore files in our root project directory.

Inside .prettierignore it‚Äôs better to add whatever we have inside .gitignore file.

Then we can run this command inside our project to format it.

npx prettier --write .
Inside .prettierrc.json we can change the default settings by overriding them.

The settings I use most of the time are this:


The prettier config that I use.
That‚Äôs it about Prettier. But we are not finished.

There are times where ESLint and Prettier have different opinions about code formatting and style. That‚Äôs why we need to tweak this part. More info here.

Configure Prettier to be used as an ESLint plugin

For ESLint and Prettier to play well together, we need to run Prettier as an ESLint plugin. This way we can just call ng lint ‚Äî fix and ESLint will fix bugs but also format the code.

Open terminal and type:

npm install prettier-eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev
or

yarn add prettier-eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier -D
Now we need to edit the .eslintrc.json file to include the prettier plugin.


VSCode and Webstorm shortucts

That was it. We‚Äôre done with the configuration part.

After we edit a file, we want to format it and then save. That‚Äôs what we will configure now for both VS Code and Webstorm.

First make sure you have ESLint and Prettier plugin installed. WebStorm has support out-of-the-box for both.

For VS Code we need to add this lines to settings.json:


For Webstorm:
We need to check: Run eslint ‚Äî fix on Actions On Save settings page:


Webstorm Fix File on save

How to automate all these configurations?
As you saw, there are a lot of packages that you should install and configure. And I can tell you confidently that there is a way to manage all these automatically. NX is the answer.

What is NX?
NX is the next generation build system with first-class monorepo support and powerful integrations.

If we migrate our Angular app to an Nx monorepo (there is a straightforward migration path) we get all those configurations for free out-of-the-box.

But what makes NX special are some crazy features like computation caching, smart rebuilds, distributed task execution, remote build caching, powerful code generators, editor plugins, etc.
