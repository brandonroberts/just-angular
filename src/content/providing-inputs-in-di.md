# Providing inputs in DI üéÅ

When working with Angular, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This is usually done using `@Input` properties. However, as the application grows, we might find ourselves in a situation where we have to pass the same data through multiple levels of components. This is known as prop drilling and can make our code harder to maintain and understand.

In this article we will see how we can use the new Signal Inputs and Dependency Injection to provide inputs to components without having to pass them through multiple levels of components.

## Before Signal Inputs

Let's start by looking at an example of how we would pass data from a parent component to a child component using `@Input` properties.

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `<app-child [data]="data" />`,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  @Input() data: string;
}

@Component({
  template: `<app-inner-child [data]="data" />`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() data: string;
}

@Component({
  template: `{{ data }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  @Input() data: string;
}
```

In this example, we have a `ParentComponent` that passes data to a `ChildComponent`, which in turn passes the data to an `InnerChildComponent`. This is a simple example.

In order to solve this problem, we have used what we call services.

So, it will look something like this:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DataService {
  data: string;

  setData(data: string) {
    this.data = data;
  }
}

@Component({
  template: `<app-child />`,
  providers: [DataService],
})
export class ParentComponent {
  dataService = inject(DataService);

  // using ngOnChanges to update the data in the service
  @Input() data: string;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    if (changes.data) {
      this.dataService.setData(this.data);
    }
  }

  // or using a setter
  @Input() set data(value: string) {
    this.dataService.setData(value);
  }
}

@Component({
  template: `<app-inner-child />`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  // no need to inject the service here as we don't need it here
}

@Component({
  template: `{{ dataService.data }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  dataService = inject(DataService);
}
```

This works great, until we need to convert our components to use `OnPush` change detection strategy.
Because we are not using `@Inputs()`, Angular cannot check if the data has changed and will not update the view (if the event didn't come from the child component itself).

To solve this we have relied on rxjs `BehaviorSubject`. Why? Because we can subscribe to it and get the latest value whenever it changes and subscribe to changes using async pipe which will trigger `markForCheck` under the hood that lets Angular know that this component's data has changed.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DataService {
  private readonly data = new BehaviorSubject<string>("");
  readonly data$ = this.data.asObservable();

  setData(data: string) {
    this.data.next(data);
  }
}

@Component({
  template: `{{ dataService.data$ | async }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  dataService = inject(DataService);
}
```

One other way to solve this would be to inject the parent component itself into the child component and access the data directly.

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `{{ parentComponent.data }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  parentComponent = inject(ParentComponent);
}
```

This is great until you start to hit circular dependency issues.

## Signal Inputs approach

In order to benefit from Angular enhanced change detection (read more here [A change detection, zone.js, zoneless, local change detection, and signals story üìö](/blog/a-change-detection-zone-js-zoneless-local-change-detection-and-signals-story)), we can use the new Signal Inputs feature.

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `<app-child />`,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  data = input<string>();
}

@Component({
  template: `{{ parentComponent.data() }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  parentComponent = inject(ParentComponent);
}
```

This is the same as the previous example, but we are using signals instead of normal properties. This will still be affected by circular dependency issues.

What we can do is to have an `InjectionToken` which can be used to provide this component input in the DI tree.

```typescript
export const DATA = new InjectionToken<Signal<string>>("DATA");

@Component({
  template: `<app-child />`,
  providers: [
    {
      provide: DATA,
      useFactory: () => inject(ParentComponent).data,
    },
  ],
})
export class ParentComponent {
  data = input<string>();
}

@Component({
  template: `{{ data() }}`,
})
export class InnerChildComponent {
  data = inject(DATA);
}
```

Let's break down the code above:

1. We have created an `InjectionToken` called `DATA` that will hold the signal for the data. Note that it's a `Signal<string>` and not just `string` because we want to be able to read it only where we need it.

2. We have provided the `DATA` token in the `ParentComponent`'s `providers` array. We are using the `useFactory` property because it allows us to inject the `ParentComponent` and get the `data` signal from it.

3. We are not calling the `data` signal directly in the `useFactory` function because we want to be able to read it only where we need it and not have it in the DI tree.

4. We have injected the `DATA` token in the `InnerChildComponent` and assigned it to the `data` property. And now we can read the `data` signal in the template.

This way we can provide inputs to components without having to pass them through multiple levels of components and without having to rely on services or BehaviorSubjects.

Also, this is 100% compatible with OnPush change detection strategy, because we are using signals, which are part of the new Angular change detection system and will trigger change detection when the signal changes.

It is also compatible with Zoneless Angular, because signals are part of the new Angular change detection system and do not rely on Zone.js.

This is a great way to remove prop drilling from your Angular applications and make your code more maintainable and easier to understand.

## One more thing

We can also read the token in the services provided in the same component or child components.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DataService {
  data = inject(DATA); // data is a signal here

  constructor() {
    effect(() => {
      console.log(this.data()); // use data() to make API calls maybe?
    });
  }
}

@Component({
  template: `<app-child />`,
  providers: [
    {
      provide: DATA,
      useFactory: () => inject(ParentComponent).data,
    },
    DataService, // <- provide the service here
  ],
})
export class ParentComponent {
  data = input<string>();
}
```

Hope this helps you to remove prop drilling from your Angular applications and make your code more maintainable and easier to understand. üöÄ
